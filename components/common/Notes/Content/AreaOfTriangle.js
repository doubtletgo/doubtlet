      Basically, it is equal to half of the base times height, i.e. A = 1/2 × b × h. Hence, to find the area of a tri-sided polygon, 
      we have to know the base (b) and height (h) of it. It is applicable to all types of triangles, whether it is scalene, isosceles or 
      equilateral. To be noted, the base and height of the triangle are perpendicular to each other. The unit of area is measured in 
      square units (m<sup>2</sup>, cm<sup>2</sup>).`,

      triangle’s area, when we know the length of all three sides. Trigonometric functions are also used to find the area of a triangle 
      when we know two sides and the angle formed between them. However, the basic formula that is used to find the area of a triangle is:`,
