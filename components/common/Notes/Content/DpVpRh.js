      the depression of Wet Bulb below the Dry Bulb is less in still air than when the air is in move sent. 
      For temperatures of Wet Bulb higher than 0°C, Fernter modified Regnault'a equation so as to correspond 
      to (1) calm, (11) light wind and (iii) strong wind. Under the conditions of expomre obtaining in a Stevenson 
      Serena, the vele eity of air past the Wat hulb generally ennes under light wind'. Pernter's modification of 
      Regnault's formula for light wind conditions almost exactly agrees with August's formula referred to earlier 
      in this introduction, August's equation has, therefore, been used in the India Meteorological Department
