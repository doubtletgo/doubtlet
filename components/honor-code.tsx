            <strong>Doubtlet</strong> understands that the Academic process in a
            student’s life has its own crust and trough. But the integrity,
            solidarity, and commitment shown during the process make a learner
            and instructor ascend in life.
          </p>

          <p>
            We believe in the process of authentic learning and therefore
            condemn the use of this platform for any malicious, dishonest, or
            sharp practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following are the set of standards that we wish you to adhere to
            while harmonizing with us through your studies:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Plagiarism is a serious issue that is highly unjust on the side of
              an individual who has worked hard to learn.&nbsp; Please DO NOT
              copy the solutions directly from Doubtlet & other platforms and
              assert it as your own work elsewhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, it is instructed not to post someone else’s work as your own
              on this platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              We are strictly against violating any institution’s moral code and
              therefore disapprove of using this platform for solving any active
              evaluation assignments or examinations against the instructions of
              your institution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Violating the above instructions can have severe consequences and
              can lead to permanent suspension of your account or can be
              reported to your institution if found illegal in the books of your
              region.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, it is requested to report any such incident under your sight
              to Doubtlet, and our team will take immediate and necessary action
              on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              You and Doubtlet together will taste success and failure
              throughout your academics. We will undoubtedly lead the chart
              sooner or later, but only the journey with the strength of
              character will be revered.
            </li>
            <li>We wish you all the luck in the world.</li>
